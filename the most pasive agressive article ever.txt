Teams is down: Microsoft broke its own storage and is trying to fix it fast
Remember: ‘telephones’ exist, are handy for collaboration, and usually work

Microsoft’s Teams collaboration environment is experiencing an outage, depriving unknown 
numbers of people of the opportunity to enjoy video and/or audio conferences, or to access documents.
Microsoft acknowledged the issue at 01:47 UTC on July 21st and offered the following update around 75 minutes later.
The outage appears to be global but Microsoft is perhaps a little fortunate that the incident struck when the working 
day was all-but over in the USA, and in the dark of the European night. Most of the reaction 
The Register can find is therefore from the Asia-Pacific region, where businesses such as an Australian 
horse-racing organisation have been disrupted by the incident.
Others have wryly observed that the outage will allow workers some unplanned but welcome downtime.

Some are seeking to profit from the incident.

The Register would like to take this opportunity to wish readers the best during this trying time, 
and to remind them that “telephones” exist and can quite easily arrange at least three-way calls. 
Those who attend offices may also wish to consider “walking” to a “meeting room”, a facility established 
with the express purpose of allowing teams of people to interact. ®
